# Tower-of-Hanoi

This project is a simulation solving the Tower of Hanoi. The algorithm for moving the disks is more efficient that the usual naive implementation because it is iterative instad of recursive, and consequently it does not take up space to store the recursive runtime stack and also it does not it go into repeated recursion. If we have N disks, the space complexity is O(N) and the time complexity is O(2^N). This algorithm is able to achieve such efficienty because it is based on the properties of binary mathematics. Each disk is represented as a bit in a binary number. Every time the 2^0 bit is flipped the 0 disk (the smallest disk) moves. Every time the 2^1 bit is flipped the 1 disk (the next smallest) disk is moves, and so on.

In addition to the algorithm which is responsible for moving the bits, this project also utilizes another algorithm, invented by myself, which is responsible for assigning colors to the disks. This algorithm generates N evenly spaced colors on the color wheel in order to give each of N disks a distinctive color for improved human-computer interaction and aesthetics. No matter how many disks there are, the colors of the disks will always be equidistant on the color wheel. This ensures that all disks will be easily distinguishable even by people with poor vision. This algorithm is based on the mathematical properties of the color wheel that I discovered. We can't just pick random colors for each of the disks, because there is a chance that since random numbers may be very close together, like 10 and 12, the random colors may also be very close together, like red and a slightly ligher red. It means that the disks will not be easily distinguishable in this case.
